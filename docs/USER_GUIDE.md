# Curiate Solutions - User Guide

This guide will help you understand how to use the Curiate Solutions SEO Text Analyzer effectively.

## Getting Started

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the application URL:
   - If running locally: `http://localhost:5000`

2. You'll see the main interface with a text input area and an "Analyze SEO" button.

## Analyzing Text

1. Enter or paste your text into the text area.
   
   Example:
   ```
   Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.
   ```

2. Click the "Analyze SEO" button.

3. Wait for the analysis to complete (you'll see a loading spinner during processing).

## Understanding the Results

After analysis, you'll see three main sections:

### 1. Readability Score

The readability score is based on the Flesch Reading Ease scale:
- 90-100: Very easy to read
- 80-89: Easy to read
- 70-79: Fairly easy to read
- 60-69: Standard
- 50-59: Fairly difficult to read
- 30-49: Difficult to read
- 0-29: Very difficult to read

### 2. Recommended Keywords

This section displays keywords extracted from your text that might be valuable for SEO purposes. These keywords are identified based on their relevance to your content.

### 3. Updated Text Preview

This area shows your original text and allows you to see changes as you insert keywords.

## Inserting Keywords

1. Click on any keyword in the "Recommended Keywords" section.

2. The keyword will be automatically inserted at the end of your text in the preview area.

3. You can click multiple keywords to add them one after another.

4. The insertion logic will:
   - Add a space after your text if it ends with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark
   - Add a period before the keyword if your text doesn't end with punctuation

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Use complete sentences and paragraphs** for more accurate readability scores.

2. **Provide enough context** in your text to get relevant keyword suggestions.

3. **Aim for a readability score above 60** for general audience content.

4. **Don't overuse keywords** - insert them naturally where they make sense.

5. **Review the final text** to ensure it flows naturally after keyword insertion.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Empty results**: Make sure you've entered enough text for analysis.

2. **No keywords returned**: Try using more specific or descriptive text.

3. **Error messages**: Note any error messages displayed and try again with different text.

4. **Page not loading**: Verify your internet connection and that the server is running.
